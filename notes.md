- Directives
- Template Logic
- Components & Nesting
- Event Handling
- Computed Properties
- CSS Transitions & Animation

Composing with Components
- The component system is another important concept in Vue, because itâ€™s an abstraction that allows
us to build large-scale applications composed of small, self-contained, and often reusable components.

Directives
- Special attributes with the v- prefix that does something to the DOM
- Reactivley applies side effects to the DOM when the value of its expression changes
<element v-directiveld="[argument:] expression [| filters...]">
</element>
examples:
    <span>{{msg}}</span> // basic interpolation
    <span v-text="msg"></span> // using the v-text directive
    <span v-html="msg"></span> // parses html
    <span v-once="{{msg}}"></span> // one-time interpolation
